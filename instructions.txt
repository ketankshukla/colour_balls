ok so i want to create a game like tetris, but instead of tetris blocks falling from the top of the canvas, there will be colour balls falling.
Each piece, which wil be a straight line of  will six different colour balls will drop from the top of the canvas
and the player will be able to use the left arrow to move the piece left, right arrow to move the piece right,
up arrow to rotate the piece and down arrow to move the piece toward the bottom fast and the space bar to drop the piece.

Just like tetris where lines at the bottom of the canvas disappear,
in this game, when pieces stack on top of each other and you have 3
same colour balls align either horizontally, vertically or diagonally,
that will be treated as a complete line and it will disappear and the
space that is created will be filled with the individual ball that is above the space,
and once those drop and another 3-ball line is created, that will disappear and so on.

I want you to create this game in the balls folder - and more importantly, i want you to use the exact same file and folder
structure that you used to help me create the tetris game, which is in the tetris folder. Use this as a reference.
I want the UI, scoring panel and high score panels to look exactly the same, with all the dimensions and everything identical.
The only difference is the game logic and shapes of the objects.

Before you start to create anything, I ned you to verify to me that you completely understand what I want
