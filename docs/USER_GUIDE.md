# User Guide: Colour Balls

## How to Play

Welcome to Colour Balls! This Tetris-like game offers a colorful twist on the classic falling blocks gameplay.

### Objective
Your goal is to match 3 or more balls of the same color to make them disappear. As you clear balls, you'll score points and create space for new pieces. The game ends when the board fills up and no new pieces can be placed.

### Getting Started
1. Press the **S** key or click the **Start Game** button to begin
2. Each new piece is a straight line of 6 different colored balls
3. Guide each piece to create matches of 3+ same-colored balls

### Controls
- **Left Arrow**: Move piece left
- **Right Arrow**: Move piece right
- **Up Arrow**: Rotate piece
- **Down Arrow**: Move piece down faster
- **Space Bar**: Drop piece instantly
- **S**: Start the game
- **P**: Pause/resume game

### Game Mechanics
- When 3 or more balls of the same color align (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they disappear
- Balls above empty spaces will fall down
- This can trigger chain reactions when falling balls create new matches
- The game speed increases gradually as you play longer

### Scoring
- Basic match (3 balls): 100 points
- Each additional ball in a match: +50 points
- Chain reactions: 2x multiplier for each consecutive reaction
- Level bonus: Score multiplier increases with each level

### Tips
- Plan ahead to create potential chain reactions
- Look for opportunities to create diagonal matches
- Use the hard drop (Space) to place pieces quickly when you're confident
- Try to keep the board height low to give yourself more options

Enjoy the game!
